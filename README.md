<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## üéâ Plug-ins Using valence_core

Here you can find awesome plug-ins already using `valence_core` to boost their Valence nodes:

- **[valence_market](https://github.com/ABlockOfficial/valence_market)**: Build a web3 marketplace in seconds

If you'd like to have your plug-in added to the list, please open a PR and we'll be happy to take a look!

..

## How to Use

`valence_core` is designed to be used as a core crate for Valence functionality that is common across all node types and plug-ins. It is not designed to be used as a standalone crate, and will not compile as such.

..

### üîß Installation

If you have `cargo-add` installed, you can simply run the following command:

```sh
cargo add valence_core
```

Otherwise, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
valence_core = "0.1.0"
```

### üèéÔ∏è Use in Plug-ins

The `valence_core` library exposes a few common methods and functionalities that are useful if you're either using plug-ins or writing your own. This core functionality includes:

- **api:** The module here contains most of the `struct`s and `enum`s that are used to communicate between nodes and plug-ins. This includes the `JsonReply`, `ApiErrorResponse` and `APIResponseStatus` structs, as well as functions for JSON serialisation and Warp API replies.

- **db:** The module here contains all the common code associated with data storage. This includes the `KvStoreConnection` trait, which ensures consistent interfacing with data handlers across the Valence ecosystem

- **crypto:** The module here ensures consistency in the handling of cryptography across the Valence ecosystem. If you want to do anything with cryptography in your plug-in, you should use the functions here.

### Further Work

- [x] Add tests
- [x] Consider abstraction structure for API and DB handling
- [ ] Add traces
